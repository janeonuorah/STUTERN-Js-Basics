6.) In statically typed programming language, variable types are static, meaning once you set a variable to a type, you CANNOT change it. Before running the programme, the data type of each variable is checked and verified while in dynamically typed programming language, variable types are dynamic, meaning after you set a variable to a type, you CAN change it. During running the programme, if there is an invalid assignment of a variable that violates its data type then an error is given for that.
Examples of a static typed programming language C, C++, Java etc while examples of a dynamic typed programming language is Python, Javascript, Ruby etc.

7.)Undefined means a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value while null means an intentional absence of a value. Null is an assignment value.
